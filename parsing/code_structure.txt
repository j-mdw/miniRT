PARSING:

Structures:
- Structure level 1: defined with unique parameters and a pointer to line, a pointer to pointer to a split, a pointer to an element (the first one)
- Structure level 2: contains the element ID, a pointer to the specific element structure and a pointer to the next element
- Strucutre level 3: contains the parameters of specific elements
- e.g to access the parameters of the first element, struct1.elem.specific_elem.parameter

Parsing strategy
- Get_next_line
- Line split
- Get ID
- Start a function based on the ID !!HOW!!
    - Function creates a new structure level 2 and a new structure level 3 (based on the ID)
    - Fills the level 3 structure fields

Error handling:
- Error function is called if any error arises
    - Attempts to free the elements, the line * and the split ** (if they exist)
    - Printf an error message
    - Exits
